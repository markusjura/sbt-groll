# sbt-groll #

Plugin for [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org) to "roll" – view and navigate – the [Git](http://git-scm.com/) commit history. This turns out to be very useful for live coding and training sessions. As of version 2 sbt-groll is using [JGit](http://www.eclipse.org/jgit/), i.e. no local Git installation is needed.

## Installing sbt-groll ##

sbt-groll is a plugin for sbt. In order to install sbt, please refer to the [sbt documentation](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html). Please make sure that you are using a suitable version of sbt:

- sbt-groll 2.x → sbt 0.13

As sbt-groll is a plugin for sbt, it is installed like any other sbt plugin, that is by mere configuration: just add sbt-groll to your global or local plugin definition. Global plugins are defined in `~/.sbt/<SBT_VERSION>/plugins/plugins.sbt` and local plugins are defined in `project/plugins.sbt` in your project.

In order to add sbt-groll as a plugin, just add the below setting to the relevant plugin definition, paying attention to blank lines between settings:

```
addSbtPlugin("name.heikoseeberger" % "sbt-groll" % "2.3.2")
```

After adding the sbt-groll plugin like this, you should either start sbt or, if it was already started, reload the current session by executing the `reload` command. If everything worked, you should have the new `groll` command available.

## Using sbt-groll ##

sbt-groll adds the `groll` command that provides various options to view and navigate the Git history. Of course this means, that you can only use sbt-groll for projects which are using Git as version control system.

If you navigate the Git history, i.e. move to some commit, sbt-groll reloads the sbt session if the build definition changes.

In order to use sbt-groll, just execute `groll` in an sbt session, giving one of the options described below:

```
> groll show
[info] == 0bf1f60 Exercise: Connect to a remote system> groll move=bc1ac93
> groll head
[info] >> b97ef22 Exercise: HTTP server
```

## Settings ##

sbt-groll can be configured by the following settings:

- `historyRef: String`: The ref (commit id, branch or tag) used for the Git history; "master" by default
- `workingBranch: String`: The working branch used by sbt-groll; "groll" by default

## Options ##

The `groll` command must be followed by one of the following options:

- `show`: Shows the current commit id and message, if current commit is in history
- `list`: Shows the full commit history
- `next`: Moves to the next commit
- `prev`: Moves to the previous commit
- `head`: Moves to the head of the commit history
- `initial`: Moves to a commit with a message starting with "Initial state"
- `move=<commit>`: Moves to the given commit
